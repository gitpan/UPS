Description:

  This module requires input of the shipping method, origin zip code, 
    destination zip code, and weight of the package. It then connects to
    the UPS calculation server and outputs the total shipping charges and
    the UPS zone.

  It's a very simplified way of finding shipping costs based on the "Quick
  Cost Calculator" document found on the UPS Website at
    http://www.ups.com/tools/tools.html
